# Photos-Organizer

### Scanning and organizing all the photos from my family via python.

**Program Description**:
The program takes all the photos from a given directory and subdirectory into organized year / month folders.

**Process**:
It works in a pretty straightforward manner. Take all the files, figure out every month / year combo and create their respective folders. Put all the photos into their respective folders.

**Motivation**:
I have been taking photos for years and years. My family has photo albums dating back for decades. All of these photos, digital or physical, have been just in jumbled messes. I decided to organize them.

**Limitations and Challenges**:
Of course a lot of photos are missing exact dates or the dates are not accurate due to one reason or another. 

**Problem to solve**:
There are still a few hiccups due to the wide ranging date formats from so many different cameras and people. Those need to be addressed.

**Intended use**:
I hope this program can get people who have tons of photos that are just scattered into all sorts of places to be able to have them organized into dated folders.
